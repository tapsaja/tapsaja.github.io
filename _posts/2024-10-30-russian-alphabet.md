My wife has a thing with "Russia" and she started to learn the language through Duolingo.

But diferent alphabet system is really a big obstacle, makes the learning process quite challanging. And I made her a poster with Russian Cyrillic alphabet system where she can post it on the wall. I also made this PDF file available for download. Formatted in A3 size.
