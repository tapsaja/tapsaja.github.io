While _tap_ is my initial, _tapsaja_ means _just tap_ or _just tap it_. It's a personal website, a blog, and also mirrored at [blogger](https://tapsaja.blogspot.com).

The articles written in English or Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia). I don't have any plan to make them bilingual, either in English or Indonesian. It depends on what mood I was when I wrote them.
